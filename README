Task - Create a Connect4 game where a human player can play against 2 computer players

The player can also define the length of a token line required to win.
Connect4 traditionally requires a continuous line of 4 tokens. By passing in a number between 2 and 6 as command line,
argument, this can be changed.

 - Computer players take their turns automatically utilising random numbers.
 - The human player has a 'r' token
 - The computer players have 'g' and 'y' tokens
 - The application checks for winning streaks in the vertical, horizontal and diagonal planes.

To run the application:

 - open terminal
 - cd into src directory
 - javac MyConnectFour.java
 - java MyConnectFour 5

Note 5 is the winning streak required.
